Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous in the computing world.  Connected devices allow remote data acquisition, distributed processing, and remote actuation. The focus of this class will be low-level technology to implement IoT devices. By exposing fundamental operational behavior, students, when facing a design problem, will be empowered to either select an appropriate existing technology, or to develop new technologies.

 * \section sec2 Hardware

Each category will begin with fundamental operational theory. The second step will be to present reference designs that utilize the technology.  The third step will be able to evaluate performance, such as electrical power, computational performance, communication bandwidth, system reliability, and network diameter.  The course will discuss similarities and differences in the technologies. The course will conclude with an open-ended and interactive discussion of future trends in IoT.
The hardware used in these projects include
 \li MSP432 LaunchPad
 \li RSLK Max
 \li CC3100 BoosterPack (CC3100BOOST)
 \li CC2650 BoosterPack (BOOSTXL-CC2650MA)
 \li CC2650 LaunchPad (LAUNCHXL-CC2650)
 \li Educational BoosterPack MKII (BOOSTXL-EDUMKII)
 \li Building Automation Sensor BP-BASSENSORSMKII
 \li Seeed HC12<br>
