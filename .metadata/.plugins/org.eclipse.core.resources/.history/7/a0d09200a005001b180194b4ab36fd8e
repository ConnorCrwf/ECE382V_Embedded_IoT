 * \section sec1 Level of Concern
\par
The level of concern is quite high. The device is intended to replace manual bagging. So, if the device were to fail, the operator could revert to manual respiration.
\par
When paired with a bag valve resuscitator, the Automated Bag Breathing Unit (ABBU) is intended to provide continuous or intermittent ventilatory support for the care of the individuals who require mechanical ventilation. ABBU was designed to meet the ventilator shortage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The use environment is for institutional use.
